_islam_ is an Islamic library for Rust.
It is a direct port of [PyIslam](https://github.com/abougouffa/pyIslam) with a slight change in the API part.

## Why?

I have always got `panic!` working with [salah](https://github.com/insha/salah).
Previously, I have good experience with [PyIslam](https://github.com/abougouffa/pyIslam).
In my case, it is very precise and has a simple algorithm. Nowadays, I work a lot with Rust.
So here it is, `islam` is born!

## Features

- Hijri date
- Prayer times

## Usage

### Getting Prayer Times

```rust
// GMT+7
let timezone = 7;
// https://www.mapcoordinates.net/en
let jakarta_city = Location::new(-6.18233995_f32, 106.84287154_f32, timezone);
let date = Local.ymd(2021, 4, 9);
let config = Config::new().with(Method::Singapore, Madhab::Shafi);
let prayer_times = Prayer::new(jakarta_city)
    .on(date)
    .with_config(config)
    .calculate();
```

First, you need to specify `Location` with `latitude, longitude, timezone` as
parameters.
Then choose a calculation method such `Singapore`. Other methods available [in thedocs](https://docs.rs/islam/0.1.3/islam/pray/method/enum.Method.html#variants).
There are also `madhab` configurations that you [can choose from](https://docs.rs/islam/0.1.3/islam/pray/madhab/enum.Madhab.html#variants).

### Getting Hijri Date

```rust
let from_gregorian = HijriDate::from_gregorian(Local.ymd(2021, 4, 9), 0);
println!(
        "From gregorian: {}-{}-{}",
        from_gregorian.year, from_gregorian.month, from_gregorian.day,
    );
```

`from_gregorian` accepts `Date` and `correction value` as parameters.

## Acknowledgement

The calculation part of this library is a direct port of
[PyIslam](https://github.com/abougouffa/pyIslam) with a slight change in the API
part. The API took inspiration from [salah](https://github.com/insha/salah)
